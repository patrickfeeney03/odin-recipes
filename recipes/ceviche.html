    <h1>Ceviche</h1>
    <img src="./../images/Cebiche_de_corvina.JPG">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ceviche is marinated in a citrus-based mixture, with lemons and limes most commonly used. In addition to adding flavor, the citric acid causes the proteins in the seafood to become denatured, appearing to be cooked. Acid marinades will not kill bacteria or parasitic worms, unlike the heat of cooking. Traditional-style ceviche was marinated for about three hours. Modern-style ceviche, popularized in the 1970s, usually has a very short marinating period. The appropriate fish can marinate in the time it takes to mix the ingredients, serve, and carry the ceviche to the table.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g firm white fish fillets, such as haddock, halibut or pollack, skinned and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>juice 8 limes (250ml/9fl oz), plus extra wedges to serve</li>
        <li>1 red onion, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>handful pitted green olives, finely chopped</l>
        <li>2-3 green chillies, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 tomatoes, seeded and chopped into 2cm pieces</l>
        <li>bunch coriander, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</l>
        <li>good pinch caster sugar</li>
        <li>tortilla chips, to serve</l>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large glass bowl, combine the fish, lime juice and onion. The juice should completely cover the fish; if not, add a little more. Cover with cling film and place in the fridge for 1 hr 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Remove the fish and onion from the lime juice (discard the juice) and place in a bowl. Add the olives, chilies, tomatoes, coriander and olive oil, stir gently, then season with a good pinch of salt and sugar. This can be made a couple of hours in advance and stored in the fridge. Serve with tortilla chips to scoop up the ceviche and enjoy with a glass of cold beer.</li>
    </ol>
