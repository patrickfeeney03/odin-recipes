    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Paella is a rice dish originally from Valencia. While non-Spaniards commonly view it as Spain's national dish, Spaniards almost unanimously consider it to be a dish from the Valencian region. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols. It is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp each hot smoked paprika and dried thyme</li>
        <li>300g paella or risotto rice</l>
        <li>3 tbsp dry sherry or white wine (optional)</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes with garlic</l>
        <li>900ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>400g frozen seafood mix, defrosted</l>
        <li>1 lemon, ½ juiced, ½ cut into wedges</li>
        <li>handful of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add the onion and soften for 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the smoked paprika, thyme and paella rice, stir for 1 min, then splash in the sherry, if using. Once evaporated, stir in the chopped tomatoes and chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Season and cook, uncovered, for about 15 mins, stirring now and again until the rice is almost tender and still surrounded with some liquid.</li>
        <li>Stir in the seafood mix and cover with a lid. Simmer for 5 mins, or until the seafood is cooked through and the rice is tender. Squeeze over the lemon juice, scatter over the parsley and serve with the lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
